           Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything.

        <p>Music is a part of all of our lives, from when we’re growing up to when we’re old. We grow up to the sound of our mothers singing us lullabies so that we’d go to sleep. Music is one of the most calming and soothing things if you let it be. It comes from melodies and tunes strung together by people who sing and play musical instruments. The power of music shows in the simplest of things, such as when you absentmindedly tap your foot to a beat or hum a tune unknowingly.
Music is not only created by people, but it is also all around us in nature. In the mornings, when the crickets and the birds chirp, it is music. The loud sound of the waves in the ocean swishing, the whistle in the wind, and the sound of trees and leaves rustling are all their own forms of music
Music is something that we all enjoy in the course of our lives. It is the sound that is brought together through a harmony of instruments and singing voices. It is something that is part of us ever since we enter this world. Our mothers, fathers and grandparents sing us lullabies so that we can sleep peacefully. In the mornings, we listen to the birds chirping and the leaves of plants and trees rustling, and even this is like music to our ears. Music is everywhere, and all you have to do is open up your ears to hear it.

Those who know how to create music using instruments and their own bodies are called musicians. There are different kinds of instruments – percussion, string, brass, woodwind and piano/keyboard. Percussion instruments include drums, bongos, the triangle, tambourine, tabla, dholak, etc. and they are the ones responsible for giving the main beat to a song. String instruments include the harp, guitar, cello, violin, etc. and they give rhythm to the music. <p> <br>
